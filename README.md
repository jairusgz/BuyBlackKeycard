## You need to have Python3 installed, you can install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Modules needed:
- pyautogui
- keyboard

### To install the modules needed, open cmd and run the following commands:
- pip install pyautogui
- pip install keyboard

## How to use

### Search for Black Keycard on the flea market, allow bartering offers and filter only for traders. Then run the script before the trader restocks and wait for it to buy the keycard. The script is only an auto clicker, so if you are not lucky with the refresh button it may not buy the keycard before it runs out of stock.

### To stop the script hold Escape.
